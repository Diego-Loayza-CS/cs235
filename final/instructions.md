# CS 235 Final Exam

**Please carefully read and follow these instructions**

For this exam, you will pick **one** of the following tasks to implement. 
The final is worth 100 points, so some of the tasks present an opportunity for extra credit.

| Task      | Points |
| --------- | ------ |
| BST       | 100    |
| Quicksort | 100    |
| AVL       | 120    |

To complete the task, correctly implement the methods indicated in the `.h` file.

Each task comes with an associated `tests.cpp` file. 
This file contains all the tests used by the autograder.

The zip files also contains `test_utils.h` and `debug.h`. 
**To compile your `tests.cpp`**, please copy the `test_utils.h` file into the folder of the task you choose to complete.
You may use the `debug.h` file if desired.

Turn in your `.h` file containing your implementation to gradescope. 
You are allowed to submit your `.h` file as many times as needed during the 3-hour exam window.
However, you should use your local copy of `tests.cpp` to test your code. 

Have fun!
